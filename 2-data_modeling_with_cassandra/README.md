# Building ETL pipeline for Sparkify with Apache Cassandra
---

In this project, data modeling and ETL pipeline were built for the same company (Sparkify). Apache Cassandra and python were used to build the data modeling and pipelines.

## 1. Context

This time, the company wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## 2. Goals and Deliverables

The goal is to create an Apache Cassandra database and design the etl pipeline with Python to enable users to perform specific queries. There are 3 main queries that the business area requests for this project, and you can find them on the Jupyter notebook in this repository.
